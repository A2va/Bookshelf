First, you need to create all the objectives:

/function Gunivers-Lib:Import/Vectors
/function Gunivers-Lib:Import/Orientation
/function Gunivers-Lib:Import/Math
/function Gunivers-Lib:Import/Temporary
/function Gunivers-Lib:Import/ID
/function Gunivers-Lib:Import/Location


Then you need to add an identifier to you and your targets:

/function Gunivers-Lib:Entity/ID/AddUID
/execute @e[SELECTOR FOR YOUR TARGETS] ~ ~ ~ /function Gunivers-Lib:Entity/ID/AddUID


Then you need to set your score on TargetID equals to one of the UIDs of your targets:
For example if one of your targets has 4 on it's UID score, write:

/scoreboard players set @s TargetID 4


And that's all !

Now every time you want to aim at your target, write this (in the chat or in a command block):
/function Gunivers-Lib:ExampleSystems/Aimbot/Main
