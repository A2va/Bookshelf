# 🔎 What is it?

The Gunivers-libs is a modular library datapack designed to help mapmakers to implement common or complexe systems.

# ⚙️ Features

🧮 Mathematical functions (sin, cos, exp, log, sqrt...)<br>
🏷️ ID system for entities<br>
🔀 Block <-> Score conversion system supporting BlockStates<br>
🧠 Pathfinding and other NPC AI basic tools<br>
🪃 Vectors management to give customized trajectories to your entities, which can be deflected by the wind, bounce on blocks etc.<br>
📎 Entity Link to synchronize the movement of entities, create moving entity cohérent structures or adding mirrors effects

And much more!

# 🔌Installation

Go to the [Glib Manager](http://glib.gunivers.net) website to select the version and the modules you want to use. You can check the modules' content in the [Documentation](https://glib-core.readthedocs.io).

Once you download the ZIP file, simply put it into you world's "datapacks" folder and, in-game, execute the `/reload` command.

⚠️ **Be sure that "cheats" are enabled**. Or, if you are on a server, be sure that `enable-command-block` is set on `true` in you `server.properties` file.

⚠️ **Some modules can be heavy**. Like the `glib.block` or `glib.item` that contain search trees. If you download them, the reload can take some time. If you edit the datapack, be sure to compress it in a zip file before uploading it somewhere. In the other cases, the search trees will slow down the upload due to thousands of little files.

# 🏃 Motivation

As developers, we know the importance of using libraries to avoid losing time by re-inventing the wheel in each project. But in Minecraft, we often see that mapmakers are not familiar with this concept.

That's why we created this library, to propose a lot of re-usable tools and try to convice mapmakers to become real developers by looking for and using the available tools.

Thus, this lib is not made to propose the best optimized functions or the more accurate ones. Instead, it is designed to be easy to install and use, and propose various features. We give a huge importance to the accessibility and we recommend talented creators to fork this project in order to make their own optimized versions of the lib.
