# FAQ

* **Can I use the lib in my map/server project?**
Of course you can! The only thing we ask is that you get proper credit. If you are a very nice person, you can even add links to our site and Discord. If you are even nicer, you can also leave us a feedbak or your suggestion to improve the lib. Then you can also make a donation to help us develop other projects but that only happens in my dreams haha...Â ![crying](https://project.gunivers.net/plugin_assets/redmine_ckeditor/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/cry_smile.png "crying")

* **How did you do some functions?**
We have set up a dedicated space on this site and on Discord to share the things we do, and especially how we do them so that everyone can learn to do the same. You can find this space here: https://project.gunivers.net/projects/ressources/wiki/Datapacks
