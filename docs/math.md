### Basis rotation 3D

**`bs.math:algebra/basis_rotation_3d`**

Allows to obtain the equivalent of the vector
passed in parameter in a base with a different orientation. Useful to
convert an absolute/relative position into a local position for a given
entity.

```{admonition} Issue reported
:class: warning

This function is not working properly. You can follow the {octicon}`issue-opened;1em;sd-text-info` [issue](https://github.com/Gunivers/Glibs/issues/31) resolution on Github.
```

:Inputs:

   **(execution) `as <entities>`**: The entities you want to perform the computation on

   **(scores) `@s bs.var<0|1|2>`**: Vector coordinates $(X,Y,Z)$ in the starting base

   **(scores) `@s bs.var<3|4>`**: Horizontal (along $\hat{z}$) and vertical (along $\hat{\phi}$) rotation (in degree) from the starting base

:Outputs:

   **(scores) `bs.res<0|1|2>`** Vector coordinates $(X',Y',Z')$ in the target base

:Examples:

   A block is in ~2 ~5 ~10 from me, I want to have this position in local coordinate (^? ^? ^?)
   
   ```
   # One time

   # Relative coordinates (we multiply by 1000 to have more precision on the result, which will also be multiplied by 1000)
   scoreboard players set @s bs.var0 2000
   scoreboard players set @s bs.var1 5000
   scoreboard players set @s bs.var2 10000

   # Difference between my orientation (= that of the coondata grid ^X ^Y ^Z) and the orientation of the Minecraft blocks grid (~X ~Y ~Z)
   function bs.orientation:get
   scoreboard players operation @s bs.var3 = @s bs.oriH
   scoreboard players operation @s bs.var4 = @s bs.oriV

   # Perform the basic rotation
   function bs.math:algebra/basis_rotation_3d

   ```

   I want to have a vector pointing to where I'm looking, but in relative coordinates ~X ~Y ~Z (also called "classical" vector in this library)
   
   ```

special interest in algortihms (but not or not much in formal
mathematics)

### Retrieve the next power of 2

`get_next_pow2`: compute the power of 2 directly superior to the
number given in parameter on the score `bs.var0` and return the
result on `bs.res0`.

   ```
   # Once
   scoreboard players set @s bs.var0 43
   function bs.math:special/get_next_pow2

   ```

---

### Random number generator

`random`: Generates a random number and returns the result on the
`bs.res0` score

-  To reduce this interval, execute the function then do a "modulo"
   operation on the result (random % 10 -> the random number will be
   included in the interval [0;9])

*Example:*

-  Get and display a random number between 0 and 100:
   ```
   # Once
   function bs.math:special/random
   scoreboard players operation @s bs.res0 %= 101 bs.const
   tellraw @a [{"text": "random() = ", "color": "dark_gray"},{"score":{"name":"@s", "objective": "bs.res0"}, "color": "gold"}]

   Beware: the score `bs.const` does not contain all possible
   values. Make sure the value you want to use exists and initialize it
   if necessary.

**`bs.math:trig/tan`**

Compute the tangeant of an angle between 0 and 360

:Inputs:

   **(execution) `as <entities>`**: the entities you want to perform the calculation on

   **(score) `@s bs.var0`**: the angle in degrees (not shifted)

:Outputs:

   **(score) `@s bs.res0`**: the tangeant of the angle shifted by 3 digits (ex: 0.42 -> 420)

:Example:

   Calculate and display the tengeante of 42
   ```
   # Once
   scoreboard players set @s bs.var0 42
   function bs.math:trig/tan
   tellraw @a [{"text": "tan(42) = ", "color": "dark_gray"},{"score":{"name":"@s", "objective": "bs.res0"}, "color": "gold"}]
   ```
