**`bs.math:_`**

The "Math" functions, as their name suggests, are for
doing math. Before you run away remembering your indigestible and
incomprehensible lessons that you had to endure at school, you should
know that here, you won't need to do any math (in fact, it's the purpose
of the lib to simplify your life). Nevertheless, the following math
functions are theoretical, but they are also what most other systems are
based on. If you don't know what I mean, you can easily create (among
other things) raycasting with this lib. This system is essentially based
on trigonometry. But again, nothing complicated, everything is already
done ;)

### Basis rotation 3D

**`bs.math:algebra/basis_rotation_3d`**

Allows to obtain the equivalent of the vector
passed in parameter in a base with a different orientation. Useful to
convert an absolute/relative position into a local position for a given
entity.

:Inputs:

   **(execution) `as <entities>`**: The entities you want to perform the computation on

   **(scores) `@s bs.var<0|1|2>`**: Vector coordinates $(X,Y,Z)$ in the starting base

   **(scores) `@s bs.var<3|4>`**: Horizontal (along $\hat{z}$) and vertical (along $\hat{\phi}$) rotation (in degree) from the starting base

:Outputs:

   **(scores) `bs.res<0|1|2>`** Vector coordinates $(X',Y',Z')$ in the target base

:Examples:

   A block is in ~2 ~5 ~10 from me, I want to have this position in local coordinate (^? ^? ^?)
   
   ```
   # One time

   # Relative coordinates (we multiply by 1000 to have more precision on the result, which will also be multiplied by 1000)
   scoreboard players set @s bs.var0 2000
   scoreboard players set @s bs.var1 5000
   scoreboard players set @s bs.var2 10000

   # Difference between my orientation (= that of the coondata grid ^X ^Y ^Z) and the orientation of the Minecraft blocks grid (~X ~Y ~Z)
   function bs.orientation:get
   scoreboard players operation @s bs.var3 = @s bs.oriH
   scoreboard players operation @s bs.var4 = @s bs.oriV

   # Perform the basic rotation
   function bs.math:algebra/basis_rotation_3d

   # See the result
   tellraw @a [{"text": "X = ", "color": "dark_gray"},{"score":{"name":"@s", "objective": "bs.res0"}, "color": "gold"},{"text":", Y = ", "color": "dark_gray"},{"score":{"name":"@s", "objective": "bs. res1"},"color":"gold"},{"text":", Z = ","color":"dark_gray"},{"score":{"name":"@s","objective":"bs.res2"},"color":"gold"}]
   ```

   I want to have a vector pointing to where I'm looking, but in relative coordinates ~X ~Y ~Z (also called "classical" vector in this library)
   
   ```
   # Once

   # Retrieve a vector ^ ^ ^1 corresponding to a vector directed according to the orientation of the entity (we multiply by 1000 to have more precision on the result, which will also be multiplied by 1000)
   scoreboard players set @s bs.var0 0
   scoreboard players set @s bs.var1 0
   scoreboard players set @s bs.var2 1000

   # Get the orientation
   function bs.orientation:get
   scoreboard players operation @s bs.var3 = @s bs.oriH
   scoreboard players operation @s bs.var4 = @s bs.oriV

   # Reversal of the orientation since we want to have the relative orientation of the game grid compared to the orientation of the player (unlike the previous example)
   scoreboard players operation @s bs.var3 *= -1 bs.const
   scoreboard players operation @s bs.var4 *= -1 bs.const

   # Perform the basic rotation
   function bs.math:algebra/basis_rotation_3d

   # See the result
   tellraw @a [{"text": "X = ", "color": "dark_gray"},{"score":{"name":"@s", "objective": "bs.res0"}, "color": "gold"},{"text":", Y = ", "color": "dark_gray"},{"score":{"name":"@s", "objective": "bs. res1"},"color":"gold"},{"text":", Z = ","color":"dark_gray"},{"score":{"name":"@s","objective":"bs.res2"},"color":"gold"}]
